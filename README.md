# pong game
Once I started to develop this game, it was a basic pong game. Then I added some new features. For example, the sticks can move back and forth, or the ball can appear in random locations after a goal. Moreover, I gave more space to players. So, one stick can collide with another, and players can interfere with each other's turns.
